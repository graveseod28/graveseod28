- 👋 Hi, I’m Luke Graves
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much about programming as possible and making a career out of it.
-  I enjoy the problem solving aspect of coding and seeing how it can be used to change the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing on some concepts of languages that I've used in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I'm sure that there is plenty that I can learn and teach through collaboration.
- 📫 Reach out to me by email: clgraves28@gmail.com
